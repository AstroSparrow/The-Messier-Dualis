# The-Messier-Dualis
(This is the Repository of 'The Messier Dualis' Python Project as my Final Project of my Computer Science Class (Highschool))
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Some Info about the Project**
'Messier Dualis' is a Interactive GUI Based Project about the Messier List of Astronomical Objects (About 110 Objects) in the night sky.

The Application has HD images of all the Messier Objects (As best as I could fit into here) along with Information about them like (Messier Number, Common Name, Distance from Earth (Light Years), Date of Discovery, Name of the Discoverer, Object Type, Constellation of which it is a part of, Apparent Magnitude, A short Description of it (About 80 words long))

Credit also goes to 'Osric Dienda' for providing the images and some of the Data points

The goal of this project is to make others appreciate the beauty of the cosmos, and a bonus if they could leave having learned a bit more than before!

-> (PS: All the Data points and Images used here are available to download for anyone who wishes to make another project with them)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**How to Run: ** Easy! Just download the Repository, and after extraction and all those shenanigans, Run the 'Main-Program-India.exe' to experience my project!

**How to access the Data Points: ** Easy again! You can either use the '.db' file which is a sqlite3 Database for the Project having all the Data in it. **OR** Just use the '.json' file with all the info in it
(All the images used in this are availible in the Assets Folder)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**Controls: ** Use Right Arrow to move to the next object. 
               Use Left Arrow to move to the previous object.
               Use the Escape key to exit the program

There are 2 Availible Modes of Exploration in it:
**1. Randomised Exploration Mode**
**2. Serial-Wise Exploration Mode**

Randomised Exploration mode is where the program chooses random objects for you to explore from the catalogue (Using functions from the python random module)
The Serial-Wise Exploration mode is in which it shows objects in the order that Sir Charles Messier Added them in (1 -> 110)

(There is also some Soothing Music and the occasional Sound Effects availible for some Ear-Candy)

Well Anyways, That's about it for now!

I hope you enjoy my Project and have learnt something new from it :D

By-Bieeeee!! 👋
